    text: 'Next to the port office you can see a stone sculpture of a "humanized" cat. He dressed in trousers, a shirt, a cap, boots, and a kerchief on its neck. He is a sort of "yard boy". Previously, the Kanonerskiy island belonged to Finland. It was called Kissasaary. It means "Cat Island" in Finnish. Now the cat reminds us about the island past. Unfortunately the cat still does not have a name. The locals call him just like a cat on a stone. How would you call the dandy in a cap?',

On this shore there was a battery with a powder, ammunition depot. In the first half of the XVIII century the island was controlled by the Admiralty Board. The Island transformed into an educational center. Naval gunners started studding the firing skill. The place got a new name `Kanoner-skiy Island` in the French manner. That means `Cannoner Island`.Look into the distance. Breathe and dream. Imagine the thunder of the powerful cannons. What the emotions does the place now?',

    text: 'The shape of the island has changed many times both under the influence of natural phenomenons and as a result of human-made processes. In the end of 19th century, the configuration of the island has changed significantly. In particular, the territory in the North and the South became longer, a river Batareyka was filled and a part of the Kanonevsky territory went to the Gutuevsky Island. Now you stay in front of the Sea canal that was laid in 1875-1885. The sea canal is an artificial waterway in the Neva Bay extending from the estuary of the Bolshaya Neva river to the Kotlin island. It was designed to allow the ships to get to the seaport of St. Petersburg. Just imagine! It is almost 30 kilometers of waterway with greatest depth in 14 meters. It is deserved to be named. We allow you to discuss on this topic.',

It is possible for car drivers to cross the city in less than 20 minutes when using this 47-kilometres road.  But there are also some problems at this place, caused by the motorway`s noise and dust. To reduce the noise, authorities already built a second floor and a noise-protection wall on the motorway. But noise measurements still show significant violations of the allowed amount of noise at residential places. In addition, there are sometimes things falling down from the road. By now, a few buildings are abandoned because living there is not healthy anymore. To care about the residents of Kanoniersky Island, there is currently the suggestion of a new protection against the noise. Do you like this idea? What do you think about living near the bridge?',
